# ios-code-test

We'd like you to create a very simple app:
> Calculate and display each Fibonacci number from 1 -> max n possible on an iPhone with unsigned integers, and display each f(n) in a table view.  The UITableView scrolling MUST remain smooth.

Note: The formula for calculating the n'th term in a Fibonacci sequence is:
>f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

It should be written using Objective-C and XCode. Use any open source libraries or frameworks you think you need. It's ok just to target any iPhone device.
Please don't spend more than 3 hours on it, even if it's not working flawleslly. We're looking for how you think and how you structure your app.

## Submission

Please fork this repository, write some code and update this README with any relevant detail.

## Version 1.0.0

ios-code-test calculates and displays each Fibonacci number up to the maxiumum possible on an iPhone using unsigned integers while maintaining smooth scrolling in a table view.

Tested on iPhone 6S and iPhone 4S, deployment target 9.1.
